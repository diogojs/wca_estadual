# Organization

### Front-end
Front-end code is on branch `website`. It uses _Angular_, _Typescript_ and _Node_.

The website is published automatically through _github-pages_ when it's merged to the `release` branch.


### Back-end

Back-end code is on branch `backend`. It is made with _Python_, _Flask_, and uses _Docker_ for containerization.

For publishing it I found the best free hosting service is _PythonAnywhere_, so the most up to date code with adjusts to work on PA workflow is on branch `pythonanywhere`. That is the version that is currently running on production.
